      This map was created from information on the 
      <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/voters/vote-early-in-person/" target="_blank">Minneapolis city website</a>
      on October 16, 2024. You may wish to double-check the information there or find additional early vote sites
      that do not provide voter registration.
